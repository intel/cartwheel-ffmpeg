+@item max_frame_size
+Set the allowed max size in bytes for each frame. If the frame size exceeds
+the limitation, encoder will adjust the QP value by adding delta_qp for each
+pass to control the frame size. To simplify the usage, delta_qp is set to
+default.

 @item rc_mode
 Set the rate control mode to use.  A given driver may only support a subset of
 modes.
