# cartwheel : ffmpeg

Intel developer staging area for upstream patch contributions to [FFmpeg](https://github.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg).

The upstream project is tracked as a submodule in this repo.

## upstream process
To improve upstream patch quality and reduce patchset rebase efforts, we use the following process
1. Send PR1 to https://github.com/intel-media-ci/ffmpeg, add module maintainers to Reviewers
1. Got approval from one maintainer
1. Wait for 1 more workday to see any objections. If it's an urgent issue, please ask another reviewer + 1 for you.
1. Close PR1, and send it to the community, ping the community with some frequency if it's no response.
1. If the community has no response in 4 weeks or itâ€™s an urgent issue, send PR2 to https://github.com/intel/cartwheel-ffmpeg
1. Provide upstream patch link, ping maintainers for merging
1. Ping community until the patch merged in upstream

## clone

```

## apply patches
```shell
# at top-level directory
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
# at submodule directory
$ cd ffmpeg
# It is recommended to create a branch before applying the patches
$ git checkout -b <my new branch>
$ git am ../patches/*.patch
```

## rebase
```shell
# at top-level directory
$ git pull --rebase --recurse-submodule
```

## administrators

To update the submodule reference commit id to the latest upstream:

```shell
# at top-level directory
$ git submodule update --remote --recursive
$ git commit -sam "$(git diff --submodule | head -1 | sed 's/:$//')"
```

...verify the patches still apply successfully.  If they don't apply, fix them and include in new commit(s).
